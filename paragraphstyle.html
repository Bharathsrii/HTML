    <h2> overall summary</h2>
    <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">As the Devil, Lucifer tires of the millennia he spent being the Lord of Hell, punishing people. Becoming increasingly bored and unhappy with his life in Hell, he abdicates his throne in defiance of his father (God) and abandons his kingdom for Los Angeles, where he runs his own nightclub called Lux.</p>
<h2>Effect summary</h2>
<p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The Lucifer Effect is a phenomenon first discovered and detailed by psychologist Phillip Zimbardo after his infamous Stanford Prison Experiment. This theory is often described as the moment when a person steps from being good (or normal) into a state of evil.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Eventually Chloe brings baby Rory home to this found family. In the future, Rory returns to her old, ailing mother on her deathbed.
